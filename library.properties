sentence=Audio library to play Microsoft WAV files on Feather M4 Express stored in Quad-SPI memory chip
paragraph=The SAMD51 on Adafruit Feather M4 Express has large program space, but it is not nearly enough to hold more than a few seconds of precompiled audio. Hence, I developed this library to play audio clips from the 2MB Quad-SPI memory chip.
